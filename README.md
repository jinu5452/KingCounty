## Recommendations:
1. For Homebuyers:
- Consider diverse neighborhoods: Explore various neighborhoods beyond Seattle to find properties that suit your preferences and budget.
- Be flexible with age: Don't overlook older properties as they may offer unique charm or renovation potential. However, ensure thorough inspections to assess maintenance needs.
2. For Sellers:
- Highlight unique features: Emphasize any distinctive features your property offers, whether it's waterfront access, panoramic views, or historical significance.
- Consider renovations: Investing in strategic renovations or updates can enhance your property's appeal and justify a higher asking price.
